/// You are given three variables `a`, `b` and `c`  - its the coefficients of the square equation
/// return the roots of this equation as [Tuple](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/types/) type in increasing order.
///
/// If there is only one root - just put it twice.
///
/// - Warning: If no solution, return `(0.0, 0.0)`
///
/// - Returns: the `Tuple` with `Double` rounded to 2 digits.

/// Level: 😇
