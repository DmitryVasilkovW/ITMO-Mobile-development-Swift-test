# ℹ️ Repository info

This repository contains tasks for testing basic knowledge of the Swift language.

# 📚 Project

This project contains several modules containing the basic concepts of the Swift language. Let's look at how to work with these modules using the **Closures**.

## 🏛️ Project Structure

- **Closure**: The framework containing closure-related assignments.
- **ClosureTests**: Tests to check the correctness of the assignments from the `Closure` framework.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Assignments

Inside the `Closure` framework, you will find various assignments that require you to implement closures. Please complete them sequentially by opening the relevant files in your Xcode project.

## 🧑‍💻 Completing Assignments

1. Open the project in Xcode.
2. Navigate to the `Closure` folder.
3. Navigate to the `Tasks` folder.
4. Locate the assignments marked with comments and implement them by adding the necessary closure implementations.
5. After completing all assignments, ensure you save all changes.

## ✅ Running Tests

To check whether you have completed the assignments correctly, follow these steps:

1. Make sure all changes are saved.
2. Select the `ClosureTests` scheme at the top of the Xcode window.
3. To run all tests, select `Product` > `Test` (or press `Command + U`).

Once the tests finish running, you will see a report on the results:
- If all tests pass, you have implemented your assignments correctly!
- If some tests fail, check their results and adjust your implementations accordingly.
